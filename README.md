# Windows Scientific Calculator

A modern **scientific calculator** built with **C**, using the **Windows API** and the **[tinyexpr](https://github.com/codeplea/tinyexpr)** library for expression parsing and evaluation.

It supports arithmetic, trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, and power operations —   all through a clean graphical interface.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Basic operations: `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`, `^`
- 🧮 Trigonometric functions in degrees: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`
- 🧠 Scientific functions: `sqrt`, `log`, `ln`, `exp`, `10^x`
- 🎯 Constants support: `pi`, `e`
- 🖱️ Interactive GUI buttons with color-coded design:
  - 🔸 Orange for numbers
  - ⚫ Black for scientific functions
  - 🟩 Green for clear/delete
  - 🔘 Gray for operators
